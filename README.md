This game is being created via the tutorial at https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/index.html.

Running the main file will create a window on screen, in which you will see the @ symbol in a room.
This symbol represents you, the player. You can move around with the arrow keys to explore the maze.
When you move other creatures can move too, and if they are not friendly (most of them are not), and
they will move towards you to attack you. Moving towards them will attack them.

Orcs are the most abundant creature and they are relatively weakl; elves are less abundant and also fairly
weak; troll are as abundant as elfs, but trolls are much stronger - be careful.

See if you can explore the whole maze and defeat all the creatures.

Good luck, and enjoy (:
